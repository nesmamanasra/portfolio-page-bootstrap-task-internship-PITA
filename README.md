## what is this page?
This page contains my personal and technical information and some of my personal photos

## How I did it?
- First I create html css js files and add folder for images and add my cv
- In the HTML file, I copied the bootstrap CDN and pasted it inside the file, and then I started writing codes and using container class and also I took ready-made codes from bootstraps like navbar and card, and using row and col-md-6 helps me make the responsive web.
-In a css file I imported a specific type of font for my site And I write many formats, including flexbox, to make my site beautiful.
- In the js file, I needed to create a js file to write the code which is 'typed.js'
Where I used this library inside the html and wrote the code in JavaScript, I saw this method in several places and liked it, so I put it inside my site.

## Languages And Tools:
- HTML CSS, CSS Freamework 'Bootstrap", Js 'typed.js'
